<h1 align="center">Hi I'm Shafi Anwar</h1>

---

I’m a passionate developer from Indonesia with a strong focus on Software Engineering and Frontend Development. I’m also expanding into AI & Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, and Data Engineering, while continuously building impactful applications with future-driven technologies.  

I focus not only on coding, but also on **Problem Solving & System Design** — areas where AI still struggles. Understanding business needs, creating solid architectures, and making strategic decisions are skills I constantly sharpen to build impactful solutions.  

Currently developing full-stack apps with **React, Next.js, Node.js**, exploring **Machine Learning & Data Science**, deploying projects with **Railway, Vercel, Docker**, and diving into **Cybersecurity & System Design**.
